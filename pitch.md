# Aren't Swift supposed to be easy? Why do I keep getting "Thread 1: Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value" ?!



You set out to learn how to program iOS apps, you downloaded Xcode and followed several online tutorials to learn iOS development and it seems to go well with the tutorials. But once you decided to start coding on your own, you are immediately stumped by some weird looking symbols like :

1. **nameLabel: UILabel!**
2. **as! PersonTableViewCell** 
3. **name: String?**



What do those
